# B-ZONE
B-Zone is a 3D survival shooter game on Unity 3D and programmed using C#, the idea of this game came from me wanting to create my own shooter game survival game similar to that of Call of Duty Zombies whilst also improving my skills on Unity and improve my own experience within game design.  The goal of the game is for a user to control their own sprite and survive waves of zombie hoards by killing and dodging them with each hoard being deadlier than the last, how long can the player survive?
